Breakdown of lab:

2 - model estimation 1-d for a,b

	parametric, assume normal
	for class a, plot p_est (norm) and true p (norm)
	for class b, plot p_est (norm) and true p (exp)

	parametric, assume exp
	for class a, plot p_est (exp) and true p (norm)
	for class b, plot p_est (exp) and true p (exp)

	parametric, assume uniform
	for class a, plot p_est (uni) and true p (norm)
	for class b, plot p_est (uni) and true p (exp)

	non-parametric, parzen method
	for class a, stdev 0.1, plot p_est and true p (norm)
	for class a, stdev 0.4, plot p_est and true p (norm)
	for class b, stdev 0.1, plot p_est and true p (exp)
	for class b, stdev 0.4, plot p_est and true p (exp)
