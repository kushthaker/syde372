Requirements: perform and plot a set of classifiers on two sets of 2D sample data:
one classifying between 2 classes, and one between 3

Classifiers:

MED (case 1 done)
GED 
NN
k-NN
MAP

Required information about sample data:

- sample data (done)
- discrete grid (done - meshgrid)
- mean (done)
- covariance matrix (done)
- euclidean distance of each point from class mean (done)
- fast generalized euclidean distance function
- std deviation
- unit stddev contours 
- number of standard deviations from mean
- weight matrix
- weighted mean/standard deviation + stddev contours 
- eigenvalues/eigenvectors (done)
- euclidian distance from sample point 


MED logic: done

GED logic:
- get classes, means, covariance matrices
- build weight matrix for each class
- find weighted distance discriminant functions
- Perform MED classifier logic
--Note: dw(x,z)=[(x-z)'W'W(x-z)]^(1/2) (note: ' = transform)

NN logic:
- get classes, position of each data point
- get mesh grid
- For each point in grid:
--- Find distance to all other sample points in a class, and keep in a sorted list
--- Take smallest (nearest) of these distances
--- Repeat for each class
--- Compare distances to nearest neighbor in each class, and use to classify each grid point

k-NN logic:
- get classes, position of each data point
- get mesh grid
- For each point in grid:
--- Find distance to all other sample points in a class, and keep in a sorted list
--- Take kth-smallest (nearest) of these distances
--- Repeat for each class
--- Compare these distances for each class, take smallest, and use to classify each grid point

MAP logic:
(TBD)
